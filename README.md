    - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/miosync-masa/bayesian-event-detector/blob/main/lambda3_numpyro/examples/lambda3_colab_setup.ipynb)
    - *Use*: Advanced Bayesian causal inference, scalable multi-network diagnostics, academic & production-grade analytics

## 🚀 Concept

Classical Bayesian and VAR models are great... until reality hits:  
markets, climate, biology—all full of jumps, switches, surprises.

**Lambda³** (Λ³) separates the “smooth trend” from explicit “jump (event)” states—so you can track not just *when* and *where* something changes, but *why* (structurally) and *how confidently*.

- No more curve-fitting tyranny.
- Events are first-class citizens.
- Everything’s human-interpretable.

> "Why is my Bayesian fit so blind to regime changes?"  
> "I wish I could just see what caused that spike..."

Welcome to the new standard.

## 🔎 What is Lambda³?

- Bayesian, event-driven modeling for time-series analysis
- Separates smooth trends and jump events
- Models asymmetric & time-lagged interactions
- Works with time, transaction ID, or order index
- All coefficients are interpretable

⸻

🧪 Testing

Run basic tests (pytest required):

pytest

⸻

## ⚡ Performance

- **Colab A100 (CPU backend):**
  - `T = 10,000` time steps × 4 params, `16,000` draws × 4 chains
  - **Sampling speed:** ~80–85 draws/sec (`1 chain ≈ 3 min`)
  - **Total walltime:** ≈ 12–15 min for full model
  - **No divergences, stable adaptation, rapid convergence**
- **Small demo:**  
  - `T = 300` × 4 params, 6,000 samples → **~14 sec**
- **Scaling:**  
  - Handles **T > 10,000** on free Colab or better with no sweat
  - For very large jobs: use **NumPyro + GPU** for massive speedup
- **Feature extraction** uses **Numba/JIT** for 100× acceleration

> Real Bayesian MCMC with this speed is rare! You can safely analyze massive real-world jumps and network structure—even on public Colab.

**NOTE:**  
This public MIT version provides an *entry-level Lambda³ Bayesian event detector* (L3-JED).  
The *full Lambda³ dynamical equations and advanced topological conservation principles*—requiring explicit feature engineering  
(e.g., custom structural tensors, domain-specific progress vectors, and adaptive synchronization rates)—are **NOT included**.  
These are recommended only for advanced users or domain experts.  
What you define as a "jump", "synchronization rate", or "topological conservation" must be carefully designed based on your application and is outside the scope of this entry-level tool.
