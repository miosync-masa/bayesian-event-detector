# üöÄ Concept

Classical Bayesian and VAR models are great... until reality hits:  
markets, climate, biology‚Äîall full of jumps, switches, surprises.

**Lambda¬≥** (Œõ¬≥) separates the ‚Äúsmooth trend‚Äù from explicit ‚Äújump (event)‚Äù states‚Äîso you can track not just *when* and *where* something changes, but *why* (structurally) and *how confidently*.

- No more curve-fitting tyranny.
- Events are first-class citizens.
- Everything‚Äôs human-interpretable.

> "Why is my Bayesian fit so blind to regime changes?"  
> "I wish I could just see what caused that spike..."

### What is a "jump-event"?

A **jump-event** is an abrupt, discrete structural change in a time series ‚Äî a sudden ‚Äújump‚Äù rather than a slow drift or regular fluctuation. Unlike classical *change-point detection*, which finds broader regime shifts, or *outlier detection*, which flags rare extreme values, a jump-event specifically marks a moment where the underlying process rapidly changes state (for example: price shock, heart rhythm flip, regime switch).  
Jump-events capture both the direction (positive/negative) and magnitude of these structural pulses, enabling you to analyze how, when, and why critical transitions occur ‚Äî not just whether the mean or variance has shifted.

> In Lambda¬≥, jump-events are treated as first-class structural events ‚Äî the core ‚Äúparticles‚Äù of change, not just noise or anomalies.

| Method                   | What it detects                                   | Typical Output          | Example Use Case                | Limitation                          | Lambda¬≥ Usage      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Jump-event detection** | *Abrupt, local, signed* structural changes        | List of jump events<br>(location, sign, magnitude) | Causal impact, shock propagation, structural analysis | May be ‚Äúhidden‚Äù if only looking at means/variance | **Core primitive (‚Äúevent-pulse‚Äù)** |
| **Change-point detection** | Broad regime shifts or statistical changes<br>(mean/variance/trend) | Change-point indices<br>(segment boundaries) | Regime segmentation, volatility regime, drift | Misses small, rapid events; only coarse boundaries | Used for regime annotation |
| **Outlier detection**    | Rare, extreme values<br>(anomalies, noise, errors) | Outlier indices/flags  | Data cleaning, anomaly detection | Not always meaningful<br>for structure; may mix noise & real jumps | Used for data QC<br>(not structural) |

> **Tip:**  
> - Jump-events = Local, structural "pulses" that drive system evolution.  
> - Change-points = Big regime shifts (segments, plateaus).  
> - Outliers = Rare anomalies, usually noise or data error.  
>
> *Lambda¬≥ makes jump-events the main unit of analysis: they are not ‚Äúnoise‚Äù‚Äîthey ARE the change.*

# ü¶ã Lambda¬≥ Butterfly Effect Analysis on GCP Cloud Run

## Why Cloud Run is the Ultimate Choice

### The Essence of the Butterfly Effect
*"A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas..."*  
‚Üí In Lambda¬≥ theory, even the tiniest structural change (ŒîŒõC) can propagate into global-scale phenomena.

### Lambda¬≥ √ó Cloud Run: A Perfect Match
- **Auto-scaling:** From one "butterfly flap" (single API call) to a thousand tornadoes (1000+ concurrent requests)
- **True serverless:** Pay only for what you use (analyzing one butterfly event may cost less than $0.001)
- **Global reach:** Monitor "flaps" from around the world, simultaneously

## üöÄ Deploy in 5 Minutes

### 1. Minimal Configuration (single-file example)

```python
# main.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import numpy as np
from lambda3_abc import calc_lambda3_features_v2, L3Config

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/butterfly', methods=['POST'])
def detect_butterfly():
    """Detect micro-structural changes (the 'flap')"""
    data = request.json

    # Lambda¬≥ analysis
    features = calc_lambda3_features_v2(
        np.array(data['timeseries']),
        L3Config(delta_percentile=99.9)  # Detect only rarest events
    )

    # Butterfly effect score calculation
    butterfly_score = np.sum(features[0]) * features[2].max()  # jumps √ó max_tension

    return jsonify({
        'butterfly_score': float(butterfly_score),
        'will_cause_tornado': butterfly_score > 10.0,
        'affected_region': predict_impact_zone(features)  # you can define this
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

  - asia-northeast1     # Tokyo
  - us-central1         # Texas
  - europe-west1        # London
  - southamerica-east1  # Brazil

      --image=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/butterfly:latest &
  done
```
## üî• Real-World Use Cases

- **Financial Markets:**  
  Detect the "butterfly trade" that triggers global crashes.

- **Social Networks:**  
  Analyze when a single tweet becomes a viral phenomenon.

- **Medical (EEG):**  
  Predict epileptic seizures from subtle brainwave anomalies.

- **Earth Monitoring:**  
  Real-time global anomaly detection for disaster prevention.

---

## üöÄ Why is this revolutionary?

- **No supercomputers needed:**  
  Cloud Run's auto-scaling with efficient Lambda¬≥ means you can monitor Earth-scale complexity for the price of a coffee.

- **Real-time, global, event-driven analysis** for any spatio-temporal data.

- **Open science:**  
  Anyone can deploy and experiment in minutes.
